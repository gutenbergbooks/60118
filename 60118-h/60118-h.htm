<p>Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, one of more
than 280 areas administered by the National Park Service,
United States Department of the Interior, was set aside because
of its outstanding archeological values. This area belongs
to you and is part of your heritage as an American
citizen. The men and women in the uniform of the National
Park Service are here to assist you and will welcome the
opportunity to make your visit to Casa Grande Ruins more
enjoyable.</p>
<p>The National Park Service was created in 1916 to preserve
the National Parks and Monuments for your enjoyment
and that of future generations. Federal law prohibits
activities which would destroy any of the works of nature
or man that are preserved here. These include such activities
as hunting, woodcutting, collecting&mdash;even taking of small
pieces such as broken pottery. Please help preserve Casa
Grande Ruins National Monument, and remember: A
thoughtless act on your part can destroy in a few moments
something that has been here for centuries. <b>Please stay on
the designated trail.</b></p>
<p class="center"><span class="ss">DON&rsquo;T FORGET YOUR CAMERA</span></p>
<h1 title=""><span class="ss">Casa Grande Ruins Trail</span></h1>
<p>The Casa Grande Trail is about 400 yards long and an
easy walk. Numbered stakes along the trail are set at points
of interest, and corresponding numbered paragraphs in this
booklet explain the features.</p>
<p>You may enter the Casa Grande (Big House) only on a
ranger-conducted guided tour.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><b>1.</b></h3>
<p>From about 2,000 years ago until about A.D. 1450,
people living in this area developed and expanded a stone-age
civilization that the archeologists call the Hohokam
(Ho-Ho-Kahm) culture. Hohokam means &ldquo;those who have
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
gone&rdquo; in the language of the nearby Pima Indians, who are
probably descendants of these prehistoric people.</p>
<p>The Hohokam lived in this region for many centuries before
building walled villages like this between A.D. 1300
and 1450. Primarily farmers, raising corn, beans, squash,
and cotton, they developed extensive irrigation canal systems
that took water from the Gila (Hee-la) River. About
A.D. 1450, this village and others like it were abandoned.
We do not know why. When the Spaniards explored this
area, they found Pimas, living in open villages and irrigating
their farmlands, several miles to the west.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><b>2. Village Wall.</b></h3>
<p>The wall around this village originally
stood 7 to 11 feet high. There were no doorways in it. This
wall and building of this village are of caliche, a limy subsoil
found 2 to 5 feet below the surface of this region. To
get in or out of the village the Indians used ladders to climb
over the wall. The foundations, all that remain of the wall,
are covered with wire reinforced, tinted-cement stucco to
protect them. Stepping or sitting on the walls may damage
them. Help us to protect the walls.</p>
<h3 id="c4"><b>3. Living Room.</b></h3>
<p>This room is one of approximately 60
rooms inside the compound wall. Walls and floors were
made of caliche, and ceilings were layers of poles, saguaro
ribs, and reeds capped with a covering of caliche. Some
rooms, like this one, had doorways; other rooms had hatchways
in the roof centers. A small clay fire pit, about 1 foot
in diameter, was in the center of each room. During hot
weather, cooking was done out of doors. (<i>See</i> <a href="#fig1">next page</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c5"><b>4. The Casa Grande&mdash;Northeast Corner.</b></h3>
<p>The Casa Grande
was first seen by a European on November 27, 1694,
when Father Kino, a Jesuit missionary and explorer,
visited the area. He called the building the Casa Grande,
or Big House, because it was the biggest structure he had
seen in southern Arizona.</p>
<p>The large steel canopy was erected in 1932 to protect the
Casa Grande from rain. This building has not been restored,
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
but to keep it from crumbling further, the ruin was
stabilized in 1891. The undercut base of the ruin was filled
with bricks and cement, two-by-fours were placed over the
doorways, and two steel rods were inserted to brace the
south wall.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h3 id="c6"><b>5. The North Side.</b></h3>
<p>The wood over the doorway is not
original. There is no original wood remaining in the Casa
Grande. Father Kino reported it as burned out prior to his
1694 visit.</p>
<p>Though four stories high, only the upper three stories of
the Casa Grande were used. The five ground-story rooms
were filled with earth to form a platform foundation, and a
ladder was used to gain access to the second story through
the doorway seen here.</p>
<p>To the right of the doorway and about shoulder high are
a line of holes in the wall. These show where a roof, probably
for shade, was socketed into the wall.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><b>6. West Side.</b></h3>
<p>Notice the series of horizontal cracks along
the west wall of the Casa Grande. The cracks show that the
walls were built with layers of caliche mud. Each layer was
about 26 inches thick. Bricks were not used. The Indians
did not make adobe bricks until taught by the Spanish
priests centuries later.</p>
<p>Above the enlarged open doorway is a blocked one. The
upper doorway was sealed by the Indians, but they left a
small opening for ventilation at the bottom of the block.
The large hole above the blocked doorway is where the
original wooden lintel poles rotted away, causing part of
the wall to fall.</p>
<p>Both to left and right of the blocked doorway are small
windows in the north and south rooms. The left window
is round and the right window is square.</p>
<p>In the 1880&rsquo;s, Ed Schieffelin, the founder of Tombstone,
Arizona, took this photograph of the Casa Grande. The
structure has deteriorated little since then.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><b>7. South Side.</b></h3>
<p>Here are two more blocked doorways
that originally led into the west second and third-story
rooms. Doorways made by these Indians are smaller than
modern entryways, but this does not mean that the people
were small. During bad weather these openings could have
been closed off with mats and skins, and the smaller the
doorway, the easier it was to block. Moreover, it let in
less cold air.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The round holes in a line between the doorways were
beam sockets. Poles of pinyon pine and/or juniper formed
the ceilings and spanned the width of the room.</p>

<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="386" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Cross-section Drawing of a Roof.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The interior plaster of the west wall was made from
caliche, ground fine in a stone mortar and with the gravel
sifted out. This plaster is more than 650 years old.</p>
<p>Names cut into the plaster date from the last half of the
last century, and were cut into the plaster before the ruin
was protected by the Federal government. Because of these
names, and the fact that the interior of the Casa Grande
may easily be vandalized, visitors are permitted to enter the
ruin only on ranger-conducted guided tours.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><b>8. Southeast Corner.</b></h3>
<p>The walls of the Casa Grande are
heavy and massive, ranging in thickness from 4&frac12; to 1&frac34;
feet. To save work and to reduce weight on the foundation,
the Indians narrowed the walls as they built them up.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
The outside surface bows inward
as the wall rises. The
inside surface, however, is
nearly vertical. (<i>See</i> <a href="#fig5">photo</a>).</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c10"><b>9. Buried Walls.</b></h3>
<p>If you
look closely at the surface of
the ground you can see the
tops of the walls of some
rooms. These rooms are unexcavated.
Probably the floor
of this room is less than one
foot below ground surface,
and only the foundations of
the walls remain.</p>
<h3 id="c11"><b>10. Southwest Building.</b></h3>
<p>The high walls shown at top
of the next page are all that
remain of a three-story building
that stood in this southwest
corner of the walled village.
These rooms apparently
were living rooms where several
families slept, worked,
and stored their food, tools,
and clothing. One of the large
red Hohokam jars in the Visitor
Center exhibit room was
recovered near here.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><b>11. Outer Wall.</b></h3>
<p>This is another
part of the village wall.
To save labor, the west side
of the three-story building
was built against the wall.
During the winter of 1906-07,
Dr. J. W. Fewkes conducted
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
excavations in this ruin for the Smithsonian Institution.
He found debris along the outside of the wall indicating
that it once stood 7 to 11 feet high. (<a href="#fig7">Bottom</a>, left).</p>

<h3 id="c13"><b>12.</b></h3>
<p>From this vantage point you can view the whole compound.
The walls enclosed an area of 2&#8539; acres. Most of
the dwellings in the village were one story high.</p>
<p>In 1951, Paul Coze, an Arizona artist, painted a restoration
of the Ruin. This painting, on <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>, may help you
visualize what the village looked like 650 years ago. The
high standing walls to your left are remains of the tall
building in the lower left-hand corner of the painting.</p>
<p>The prehistoric Indian canal used to irrigate farmlands
in this area lay north of the Monument but curved to the
south and passed near the farm shed visible one-half mile
to the west. The high bank to the south and west is the line
of the modern canal. The Indians cultivated the land to the
west beyond the modern canal, walking from one-half to
one mile to reach their fields.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><b>13. Southeast Quarter.</b></h3>
<p>The vacant area to your right
once had houses on it, but they were of rather flimsy upright-pole-and-mud
construction and little remains of them
but floors and wall post holes. The open places in the
village were used for children&rsquo;s play, work areas, outdoor
cooking, and other purposes.</p>
<h3 id="c15"><b>14. The Casa Grande.</b></h3>
<p>Again we come back to the Casa
Grande. This is a unique structure in this region and its
major purpose or function is not known. It does not have
the appearance of a normal dwelling. Theories that the
structure might have been a fort-like watchtower fail to
explain what people the Casa Grande folk might have been
watching. (There is no real evidence of warfare or strife.)
Recent investigations have suggested that certain openings
in the upper walls may have been utilized for astronomical
observations, but whether the entire structure was built for
this purpose is mere speculation.</p>

<h3 id="c16"><b>15. Font&rsquo;s Room.</b></h3>
<p>This building stood two stories high.
Socket holes for the first-story ceiling can still be seen on
the east side of the high wall. The room is called Font&rsquo;s
Room for Father Font, a Spanish Franciscan priest who
visited here in 1775.</p>

<h3 id="c17"><b>16. The Trash Mound.</b></h3>
<p>Look over the village wall and to
the east, between the residences and the Visitor Center.
About 150 feet away is the low mound that was one of the
trash dumps for this village. This is where the Hohokam for
over a century threw their broken pottery, tools, shell jewelry,
garbage, and other refuse. From this mound came
much of our information about the material remains of
these ancient people. In order to protect archeological
values, visitors are not allowed on the mound.</p>
<h3 id="c18"><b>17. Shell Pendants.</b></h3>
<p>The turquoise and shell mosaic emblems
in the Visitor Center jewelry exhibit were found in
1926 in the west end of this room during excavations to
stabilize the walls. They are exceptionally fine examples of
prehistoric mosaic handicraft. (<i>See</i> <a href="#fig11">photo on back cover</a>).</p>

<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND ACT OF 1965</span></h2>
<p>America&rsquo;s growing need for outdoor recreation areas
was recognized by Congress with the passage of the Land
and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. This law authorizes
entrance and users&rsquo; fees at Federal Recreation Areas
and dedicates the money from those fees, plus revenue
from the sale of surplus Federal real estate and the Federal
tax on fuel used in pleasure boats, to the purchase and
development of public recreation lands and waters.</p>
<p>Roughly 40 percent of your entrance fee goes to buy
additional Federal Recreation Areas&mdash;a share in the California
Redwoods, a bit of Fire Island, a view from Spruce
Knob, a safe haven for the vanishing whooping crane, or
the purchase of Hubbell Trading Post in northeastern Arizona.
The other 60 percent goes to the states and through
them to towns and counties to buy and develop &ldquo;near to
home&rdquo; recreation areas such as Picacho State Park, Arizona.
These grants are matched with an equal amount from
state and local sources.</p>
<p>The $10 annual permit which is valid for some 7,000 Federal
areas administered by the National Park Service, Forest
Service, Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, Bureau
of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Tennessee
Valley Authority and Corps of Engineers may be purchased
at Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. For additional
information about the Land and Water Conservation Fund
Act of 1965 ask a ranger.</p>
